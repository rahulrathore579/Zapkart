Database Schema

Create a table named products with the following columns:

Column Name	Data Type	Description
barcode_id	varchar(255)	Unique barcode ID
product_name	varchar(255)	Product name
quantity	int	Quantity of the product
price	decimal(10, 2)	Price of the product
total_price	decimal(10, 2)	Total price of the product
Note: Replace your_username, your_password, your_database with your actual database credentials and name.

This code assumes that you have a barcode reader that can send the scanned barcode data to the input box. 
When the user clicks the "Scan" button, the code sends an AJAX request to the get_product_details.php file,
 which retrieves the product details from the database based on the scanned barcode. The product details 
 are then displayed in the table.
